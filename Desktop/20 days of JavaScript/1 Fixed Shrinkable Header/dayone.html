        <p>“Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains.”
            “Man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest.”
            “The world of reality has its limits; the world of imagination is boundless.”
            “Only passions, great passions can elevate the soul to great things.”
            “Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet.”
            “We swallow greedily any lie that flatters us, but we sip only little by little at a truth we find
            bitter.”
            “The philosopher has never killed any priests, whereas the priest has killed a great many
            philosophers.”
            “From fanaticism to barbarism is only one step.”
            “Free people, remember this maxim: we may acquire liberty, but it is never recovered once it is
            lost.”
            “Watch out for the fellow who talks about putting things in order! Putting things in order
            always means getting other people under your control.”
            “There are things I can't force. I must adjust. There are times when the greatest change needed
            is a change of my viewpoint.”
            “It is very important not to mistake hemlock for parsley, but to believe or not believe in God is
            not important at all.”
            “What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness?”
            “No man has any natural authority over his fellow men.”
            “A feeble body weakens the mind.”
            “Happiness: a good bank account, a good cook, and a good digestion.”
            “We are born weak, we need strength; helpless, we need aid; foolish, we need reason. All that
            we lack at birth, all that we need when we come to mans estate, is the gift of education.”</p>
